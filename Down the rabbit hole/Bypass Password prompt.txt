Saving username and password with TortoiseGit

Saving your login details in TortoiseGit is pretty easy. Saves having to type in your username and password every time you do a pull or push.

Create a file called _netrc with the following contents:

machine github.com
login yourlogin
password yourpassword
Copy the file to C:\Users\ (or another location; this just happens to be where I’ve put it)
Go to command prompt, type setx home C:\Users\

SSH links rather than URL aka HTTPS to bypass password prompt?
