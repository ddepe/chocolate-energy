Generating a new SSH key ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Git Bash.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
- Generating public/private rsa key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

- Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

- Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
- Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]


Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent ----------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:

If you are using Git Bash, turn on ssh-agent:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
- Agent pid 59566

If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, turn on ssh-agent:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
- Agent pid 59566

Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you used an existing SSH key rather than generating a new SSH key, you'll need to replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
